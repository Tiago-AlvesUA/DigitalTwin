### Logging folder

Contains two scripts to get network logs. `network-tt.py` obtains throughput of the network (transmitted and received bytes per second). `network-delay.py` calculates the delay a ModemStatus feature update takes to go from the vehicle to Ditto and back (the script subscribes to ModemStatus features updates using an websocket connection).
