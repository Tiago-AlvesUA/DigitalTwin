### Logging folder

Contains two scripts to get network logs. `network-tt.py` obtains throughput of the network (transmitted and received bytes per second). `network-delay.py` calculates the delay a CAM from the vehicle took to reach the MQTT broker (the script subscribes to the topic where the CAM will be received).
