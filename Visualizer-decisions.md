# Visualizer technologies choice

I will be using WebSockets since it maintains a persistent connection, unlike HTTP, which requires a new request for every server response;

Will also be using FastAPI over Node JS for example, because the agent code is already written in Python so for better interoperability that is the choice;

The API will be RESTful because i need multiple endpoints to distinguish information!? GraphQL API uses flexible queries, single query for multiple resources (using only 1 endpoint), does fewer requests and so is more efficient!?

I will be using JavaScript/React!? for the frontend part. React lets make the reusage of other code, while simple JS does not feature that.

Map -> leaflet?
